This project uses machine learning models to predict credit risk

In this project you we are building and evaluating several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data we'd typically see from peer-to-peer lending services. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans), so we will need to employ different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes. We will use the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques:

* [Resampling](credit_risk_resampling.ipynb)
* [Ensemble Learning](credit_risk_ensemble.ipynb)

Below is the list of the resources used for this project:

* [Lending Data](Resources/lending_data.csv)
* [Loan Status, 2019, 1st Quarter](Resources/LoanStats_2019Q1.csv)
